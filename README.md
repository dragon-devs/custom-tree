## Installation
`pip install dir_tree`
then run `dir-tree`

**Installation Path:** Ensure that the installation path for Python packages is included in your system's PATH environment variable. This path typically includes the Scripts directory inside the Python installation directory.

**Shell Restart:** If you're using a shell (like Bash), you might need to restart it to pick up the changes to the PATH environment variable.

**Installation Location:** Double-check the installation location of the package. If it's not installed in the expected location, you might need to investigate why the installation path is different.

**Executable Name:** Ensure that the name specified in the `console_scripts` entry point in your `setup.py` matches the command you're trying to run. In this case, it should be `dir-tree`.

**Permissions:** Make sure that you have the necessary permissions to execute commands from the installed package.

**Virtual Environment:** If you're using a virtual environment, ensure that it is activated when you try to run the command.
